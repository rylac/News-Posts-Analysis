# News-Posts-Analysis
# In this project, I analyze different posts to see what trends I can spot between posts and the number of comments, ratings, and attention they receive on the website "Hacker News". I used the datetime module quite extensively, as well was the random module for the first time.
# You can download the dataset I used here: https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts
